# Binary Addition

Binary addition works no different from "normal" addition: when two numbers in a column add up to a two-digit number, you carry the one over to the next column. Repeat the process a few times, and you have your answer. Where it differs, however, is what adding one to a column of numbers does in binary addition.

Let's use this equation as an example:

```
  1101
+ 1011
------

```
