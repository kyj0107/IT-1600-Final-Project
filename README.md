# Binary Math! by Karla Jaime

Welcome to a tutorial on binary arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division! Binary numbers is the language of computers, and knowing how to solve for them certainly wouldn't hurt!

However, keep in mind that this tutorial is intended for people who understand the concept of binary numbers and can convert them to decimals. We're taking binary numbers to new places, so knowing how they work beforehand is strongly recommended!
